        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
		<h4>First, decide on the design.</h4>
		<p>We considered what it meant to address the climate crisis. We wrote different ways to take action, linked to different organizations, created awareness via reliable news sources. </p>
		<p>We built out a wireframe. We created a design that consisted of different cards on the various pages that we would link. These cards would be easy to copy and paste into different places. We also looked at CSS templates and found one that we thought embodied the vibe  associated with environmental justice.</p>
        <h4>Then, we developed different pages, working together to create them.</h4>
		<p>I focused mainly on the home page, the navigation bar, and the petition related pages. This included research for photos, petitions, different links etc, in addition to coding html/css/js.</p>
		<h4>We built it and presented it!</h4>
		<p>After the sprint, we had a showcase event with our families and prudential staff. A year and a half later, the Girls Who Code organization wanted to showcase it at a crossover event with AOC and Girls Who Code Founder Reshma Saujani.</p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTa54JX_7zw">Watch the event here</a>
		<h4>Changes + Extensions for the Future</h4>
        <p>- Clean up code base — we didn’t know what we were doing so a lot of it was copy and paste from different OS code sources.</p>
        <p>- Work on optimizing loading - The photos are high quality which eventually leads to large loading times.</p>
        <p>- Create a tech stack - This would allow us to have news feeds, petition feeds, etc., as we had originally wanted, without having to manually update everything in the github repository.</p>
