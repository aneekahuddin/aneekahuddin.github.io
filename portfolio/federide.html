		<h3>Our Approach</h3>
		<h4>First, we figured out what exactly our problem was.</h4>
        <p>Within the course, our instructor gave the entire class an extensive syllabus including readings, videos, articles, research papers on different aspects that we would all discuss as a group. Then in class, we would engage with the actual author of one of that week’s assigned readings. It was a great way to dive deeper into what aspects of federations mattered to us, to our projects, and our personal curiosity. It helped us find the problems that people had been facing and allowed us to design with that framework in mind.  </p>
        <h4>Then, we developed a systems protocol overview by breaking it into different stakeholders.</h4>
        <p>Once we knew what the problems were and what we wanted to design we had to decide on what would make the most sense in presenting our solution and fleshing it completely out. We eventually made protocol diagrams. These were massive charts that mapped out the actions each 4 stakeholders (riders, drivers, coop leaders, and federation maintainers) would have to take when using our system. Additionally we mapped out how data would be stored and maintained in order to visually demonstrate it. We took tons of issues into consideration which could be built around these 6 principles:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Driver Ownership</li>
            <li>Centralized Versus Decentralized</li>
            <li>Democratic</li>
            <li>Scalability</li>
            <li>Justice and Systems of Power</li>
            <li>Data Privacy</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Finally, we developed an API.</h4>
        <p>With the systems protocol and the “rulebook” we created for a federation, we developed an API using Python and Flask. It’s a very limited API but is a step in the direction of developing what the federation and its protocols look like in code. </p>
        <h4>Changes + Extensions for the Future</h4>
        <p>- Edge Cases - There were definitely a few edge cases that weren’t 100% addressed in the system and we definitely would have to go back and add them into the existing system.</p>
        <p>- Has not been tested - There could be a lot of change after implementing this system since its the first of its kind in the cultural context of America.</p>
