Building out a personal website/portfolio for fun. I did one the summer after sophomore year in high school and decided that it was time for a change. The project is still under construction but feel free to visit it to start to check it out as I develop from a minimalistic template (check out the folder minimal resume). (https://aneekahuddin.github.io/index.html)

Some changes I want to make:
- Developing the Portfolio Pages - I hope to give people a deeper dive into each of my projects on a separately linked page. 
- Writing out some of the other cool projects I've worked on. 
- Personality and stylistic changes: I'm hoping to add more media, structure, and design to reflect more of who I am rather than just the minimalistic style that the portfolio is currently at!
